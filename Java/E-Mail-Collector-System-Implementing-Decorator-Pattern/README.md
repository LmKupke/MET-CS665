# Decorator Pattern - An example Implementation of E-Mail System

In this example, we have a system that creates an email as a primary object and applying the decorator pattern we can add new characteristics (responsibilities) to the object (in our case Email) at run time. 
This capability of being able to attach new responsibilities to the object is a flexible alternative to subclassing.

# Basic Idea and Concepts 

The example shows how a user can easily add a disclaimer to the email, scan it for viruses, add email addresses to BCC or remove them before sending it.

# How to compile the project

We use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. 

You need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)  on your system. 

Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

# How to create a binary runnable package 


```bash
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```


# How to run


```bash
java -classpath target/Example-1-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.bu.met.cs665.Main
```

or


```bash
run.sh 
```

# Using Findbugs 

To see bug detail using the Findbugs GUI, use the following command "mvn findbugs:gui"

Or you can create a XML report by using  


```bash
mvn findbugs:gui 
```

or 


```bash
mvn findbugs:findbugs
```

# Run Checkstyle 

CheckStyle code styling configuration files are in config/ directory. Maven checkstyle plugin is set to use google code style. 
You can change it to other styles like sun checkstyle. 

To analyze this example using CheckStyle run 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:check
```

This will generate a report in XML format


```bash
target/checkstyle-checker.xml
target/checkstyle-result.xml
```

and the following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open it using a Web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

```bash
target/site/checkstyle.html
```
